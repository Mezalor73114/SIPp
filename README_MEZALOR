This project is a modification of the SIPp project.

The objectives are :
- to launch only one call at a time
- to show only the result of the test / call
- to be able to play an audio file during the call

For that, I disabled the screen process and deleted the non-purpose options.

Finally, I also add the -af option that take in parameter a path to an audio file.
A default scenario will be played and the audio file will play durig the call.
